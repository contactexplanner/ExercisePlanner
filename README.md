[{"routineNo":1,"routineName":"Beginner Workout","stepNo":11,"stepName":"Ab Crunch Machine (1 set to failure)","stepDescription":"1. Select a light resistance and sit down on the ab machine placing your feet under the pads provided and grabbing the top handles. Your arms should be bent at a 90 degree angle as you rest the triceps on the pads provided. This will be your starting position.\n\n2. At the same time, begin to lift the legs up as you crunch your upper torso. Breathe out as you perform this movement. Tip: Be sure to use a slow and controlled motion. Concentrate on using your abs to move the weight while relaxing your legs and feet.\n\n3. After a second pause, slowly return to the starting position as you breathe in.\n\n4. Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.\n\nhttps://www.bodybuilding.com/content/best-beginner-weight-training-guide-with-easy-to-follow-workout.html","stepTime":120,"stepReps":12,"stepSets":2,"stepActivated":false,"imageLocation":"https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/exerciseImages/sequences/225/Male/l/225_2.jpg"},{"routineNo":1,"routineName":"Beginner Workout","stepNo":12,"stepName":"Air Bike (1 set to failure)","stepDescription":"1. Lie flat on the floor with your lower back pressed to the ground. For this exercise, you will need to put your hands beside your head. Be careful however to not strain with the neck as you perform it. Now lift your shoulders into the crunch position.\n\n2. Bring knees up to where they are perpendicular to the floor, with your lower legs parallel to the floor. This will be your starting position.\n\n3. Now simultaneously, slowly go through a cycle pedal motion kicking forward with the right leg and bringing in the knee of the left leg. Bring your right elbow close to your left knee by crunching to the side, as you breathe out.\n\n4. Go back to the initial position as you breathe in.\n\n5. Crunch to the opposite side as you cycle your legs and bring closer your left elbow to your right knee and exhale.\n\n6.

Sit on the machine with your back flat on the pad.\n\n2. Take hold of the handles. Tip: Your upper arms should be positioned parallel to the floor; adjust the machine accordingly. This will be your starting position.\n\n3. Push the handles together slowly as you squeeze your chest in the middle. Breathe out during this part of the motion and hold the contraction for a second.\n\n4. Return back to the starting position slowly as you inhale until your chest muscles are fully stretched.\n\n5.

Using a leg press machine, sit down on the machine and place your legs on the platform directly in front of you at a medium (shoulder width) foot stance. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances described in the foot positioning section).\n\n2. Lower the safety bars holding the weighted platform in place and press the platform all the way up until your legs are fully extended in front of you. \nTip: Make sure that you do not lock your knees. Your torso and the legs should make a perfect 90-degree angle. This will be your starting position.\n\n3. As you inhale, slowly lower the platform until your upper and lower legs make a 90-degree angle.\n\n4. Pushing mainly with the heels of your feet and using the quadriceps go back to the starting position as you exhale.\n\n5. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions and ensure to lock the safety pins properly once you are done. You do not want that platform falling on you fully loaded.\n\nhttps://www.bodybuilding.com/content/best-beginner-weight-training-guide-with-easy-to-follow-workout.html","stepTime":120,"stepReps":12,"stepSets":2,"stepActivated":false,"imageLocation":"https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/exerciseImages/sequences/57/Male/l/57_2.jpg"},{"routineNo":1,"routineName":"Beginner Workout","stepNo":5,"stepName":"Lying Leg Curls (1 set to failure)","stepDescription":"1. Adjust the machine lever to fit your height and lie face down on the leg curl machine with the pad of the lever on the back of your legs (just a few inches under the calves). \nTip: Preferably use a leg curl machine that is angled as opposed to flat since an angled position is more favorable for hamstrings recruitment.\n\n2. Keeping the torso flat on the bench, ensure your legs are fully stretched and grab the side handles of the machine. Position your toes straight (or you can also use any of the other two stances described on the foot positioning section). This will be your starting position.\n\n3. As you exhale, curl your legs up as far as possible without lifting the upper legs from the pad. Once you hit the fully contracted position, hold it for a second.\n\n4. As you inhale, bring the legs back to the initial position.

To begin, step onto the treadmill and select the desired option from the menu. Most treadmills have a manual setting, or you can select a program to run. Typically, you can enter your age and weight to estimate the amount of calories burned during exercise. Elevation can be adjusted to change the intensity of the workout.\n\n2. Treadmills offer convenience, cardiovascular benefits, and usually have less impact than running outside. A 150 lb person will burn over 450 calories running 8 miles per hour for 30 minutes. Maintain proper posture as you run, and only hold onto the handles when necessary, such as when dismounting or checking your heart rate.\n\nhttps://www.bodybuilding.com/content/best-beginner-weight-training-guide-with-easy-to-follow-workout.html","stepTime":600,"stepReps":1,"stepSets":1,"stepActivated":false,"imageLocation":"https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/exerciseImages/sequences/653/Male/l/653_2.jpg"},{"routineNo":1,"routineName":"Beginner Workout","stepNo":8,"stepName":"Triceps Pushdown - Rope Attachment (1 set to failure)","stepDescription":"1. Attach a rope attachment to a high pulley and grab with a neutral grip (palms facing each other).\n\n2. Standing upright with the torso straight and a very small inclination forward, bring the upper arms close to your body and perpendicular to the floor. The forearms should be pointing up towards the pulley as they hold the rope with the palms facing each other. This is your starting position.\n\n3. Using the triceps, bring the rope down as you bring each side of the rope to the side of your thighs. At the end of the movement the arms are fully extended and perpendicular to the floor. The upper arms should always remain stationary next to your torso and only the forearms should move. Exhale as you perform this movement.\n\n4. After holding for a second, at the contracted position, bring the rope slowly up to the starting point. Breathe in as you perform this step.\n\n5. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.","stepTime":120,"stepReps":12,"stepSets":2,"stepActivated":false,"imageLocation":"https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/exerciseImages/sequences/54/Male/l/54_2.jpg"},{"routineNo":1,"routineName":"Beginner Workout","stepNo":6,"stepName":"Wide-Grip Lat Pulldown (1 set to failure)","stepDescription":"1. Sit down on a pull-down machine with a wide bar attached to the top pulley. Make sure that you adjust the knee pad of the machine to fit your height. These pads will prevent your body from being raised by the resistance attached to the bar.\n\n2. Grab the bar with the palms facing forward using the prescribed grip. Note on grips: For a wide grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance wider than shoulder width. For a medium grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance equal to your shoulder width and for a close grip at a distance smaller than your shoulder width.\n\n3. As you have both arms extended in front of you holding the bar at the chosen grip width, bring your torso back around 30 degrees or so while creating a curvature on your lower back and sticking your chest out. This is your starting position.\n\n4. As you breathe out, bring the bar down until it touches your upper chest by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. The upper torso should remain stationary and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work except for holding the bar; therefore do not try to pull down the bar using the forearms.\n\n5. After a second at the contracted position squeezing your shoulder blades together, slowly raise the bar back to the starting position when your arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched. Inhale during this portion of the movement.\n\n6. Repeat this motion for the prescribed amount of repetitions.\n\nhttps://www.bodybuilding.com/content/best-beginner-weight-training-guide-with-easy-to-follow-workout.html","stepTime":120,"stepReps":12,"stepSets":2,"stepActivated":false,"imageLocation":"https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/exerciseImages/sequences/10/Male/l/10_2.jpg"}]
